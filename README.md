+ Hello, I'm chatbot! What would you like to ask me today?
+ Please enter your question below.
! Hey chatbot, do you know about supervised learning? 
+ Supervised learning is a paradigm of machine learning. A supervised model is built by training it on input
+ objects and desired output values which are most often labeled by humans. The training process should return a model
+ that can map unseen data to excpected output values as long as the training was done successfully.
